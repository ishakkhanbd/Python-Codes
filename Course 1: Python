#Section 1: Python Statements

#Problem 1: Use for, .split(), and if to create a Statement that will print out words that start with 's':
#Code: 
st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'
for word in st.split():
    
    if word[0]=='s':
        print(word)

#Problem 2: Go through the string below and if the length of a word is even print "even!"
#Code: 
st = 'Print every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters'

for word in st.split():
    
    if len(word)%2==0:
        print(word+' has even number of letters!')

#Problem 3: Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are 
multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
#Code: 
for num in range(1,101):
    if num%3==0 and num%5==0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
    elif num%5==0:
        print('Buzz')
    elif num%3==0:
        print('Fizz')
    else:
        print(num)
		
#Problem 4: Use a List Comprehension to create a list of the first letters of every word in the string below:
#Code: 
st = 'Create a list of the first letters of every word in this string'
[word[0] for word in st.split()]

#Problem 5: Find if there is an even number in a list. Return the even numbers.  
#Code: 
def check_even_list(num_list):
    numbering = []
    for number in num_list:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            numbering.append(number)
        else:
            pass    
    
    return numbering
